# CO2-traffic-emissions
This code offers a machine learningâ€“oriented (ML) general framework to estimate the traffic volume and average speed, which are the main variables to calculate the CO2 traffic flux on most roads.
This approach uses the most well-known ML algorithm Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) along with GIS data, road infrastructure, meteorological data, and mainly local traffic measurements.

The ML-oriented model consists of eight main steps: data preparation, data splitting, geospatial analysis, features selection and engineering, algorithm selection, feature importance, evaluation of the model, and model deployment.
